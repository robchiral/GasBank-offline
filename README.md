# GasBank

**Free, open-source anesthesiology question bank built for students who want a focused, modern study companion.**

- Curated to cover the ABA BASIC content outline with anesthesia-first framing.
- Bridges the gap between USMLE Step 2 prep and your anesthesia residency start.
- Backed by high-quality LLM drafting (GPT-5 reasoning) and cross-reviewed (Gemini 2.5 Pro) before shipping; items are re-reviewed annually.

> _“GasBank gave me focused reps on anesthesia questions that don’t show up in step prep. It felt like the missing bridge into residency.”_
