      }
    ],
    "didactic": "Vasopressor-treated hypotension is a common trigger for inadvertent anesthetic lightening, especially when neuromuscular blockade masks movement. Awareness risk rises when volatile is reduced below the amnestic range. While MAC is defined for immobility, volatile agents also provide hypnosis; clinical data and expert consensus support maintaining ≥0.7 age-adjusted MAC to minimize awareness in paralyzed patients. Opioids reduce MAC for movement but do not reliably ensure hypnosis/amnesia—an easy pitfall when trying to support blood pressure by trading volatile for opioid.\n\nWhen hypotension occurs, treat perfusion with vasopressors and volume as appropriate, and preserve hypnotic dose. Phenylephrine restores MAP by increasing SVR; maintaining the end-tidal volatile concentration near 0.8–1.0 age-adjusted MAC keeps a predictable hypnotic effect while you titrate vasopressor to achieve a MAP of ~65–75 mm Hg. End-tidal agent concentration closely tracks alveolar partial pressure and is a practical surrogate for brain partial pressure at steady state. In contrast, EEG indices (eg, BIS) can be altered by vasopressors, cerebral perfusion changes, EMG, and artifact; using BIS alone—especially targeting higher values (60–70)—may encourage dangerously light anesthesia.\n\nAdding $N_2O$ to “spare” volatile is not ideal here: MAC fractions are additive, but reducing $FiO_2$ during hypotension is undesirable, and $N_2O$ may worsen bowel distension and offers inconsistent hemodynamic benefits. Similarly, large benzodiazepine boluses risk prolonged recovery and can deepen hypotension without providing titratable hemodynamic control.\n\nKey points:\n- Maintain ≥0.7 age-adjusted MAC of volatile during paralysis; support MAP with vasopressors/volume rather than turning down hypnotic.\n- Opioids are not reliable amnestics; avoid substituting opioid for volatile when concerned about awareness.\n- Use end-tidal MAC as your primary target; use processed EEG as an adjunct, recognizing its limitations with vasopressors.\n\nPractical tip: Put the age-adjusted MAC display on your main screen and set a low-MAC alarm (eg, 0.6–0.7) for paralyzed cases so vasopressor titration doesn’t drift you into sub-amnestic ranges.",

    ],
    "didactic": "Risk of awareness is elevated during general anesthesia for cesarean delivery, especially from induction to delivery, because volatile anesthetic is intentionally limited to preserve uterine tone and neonatal status, and neuromuscular blockade prevents movement. Pregnancy reduces MAC by ~30%, but even so, pre‑delivery volatile is often kept at ≤0.5 MAC, a range close to or below $MAC_{awake}$ for some patients. Opioids provide analgesia but do not reliably produce amnesia, so relying on remifentanil or fentanyl alone risks explicit recall.\n\nIn a hemodynamically fragile parturient with ongoing fetal distress, the best strategy is to add an amnestic that preserves blood pressure and does not reduce $FiO_2$. Low‑dose ketamine (0.25–0.5 mg/kg IV) provides dissociative anesthesia with sympathetic stimulation that can support perfusion in cardiomyopathy. It does not relax the uterus or compromise maternal oxygenation. Note that ketamine may artifactually increase processed EEG indices (eg, BIS), so clinical context should guide interpretation.\n\nAlternatives have important trade‑offs:\n- Increasing volatile to 1 MAC before delivery can cause hypotension and greater uterine relaxation, endangering both mother and fetus in cardiomyopathy.\n- $N_2O$ can contribute to MAC equivalents (sum of agent fractions) with minimal uterine effects, but it reduces $FiO_2$; during active fetal bradycardia, maintaining $FiO_2$ 1.0 is prioritized until delivery.\n- Benzodiazepines add reliable amnesia but risk neonatal respiratory depression; they are typically administered after cord clamp, when volatile and opioids can also be increased.\n- Escalating remifentanil deepens analgesia but not unconsciousness and increases neonatal respiratory depression risk.\n\nAfter delivery, increase volatile (eg, to 0.8–1.0 MAC equivalents), discontinue/remodulate remifentanil, and administer a small benzodiazepine dose to secure amnesia, while optimizing uterotonic therapy and hemodynamics.\n\nPractical tip: For GA cesarean in high‑risk parturients, have ketamine (0.25–0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (1–2 mg) drawn up; give ketamine pre‑delivery if volatile must be minimized, and give midazolam immediately after cord clamp.",

Hemodynamic surrogates are imperfect, and opioids (eg, remifentanil) do not provide hypnosis.\n\nHigh-yield safeguards center on preventing and promptly detecting delivery failures:\n\n- Dedicated IV line for TIVA: Avoid Y-sites and shared stopcocks; clearly label and physically segregate the TIVA line. This removes many opportunities for inadvertent diversion/occlusion.\n- One-way and anti-siphon valves: Place a distal anti-reflux/check valve on the TIVA line beyond any Y-connectors/stopcocks to prevent backflow/dilution from pressurized carriers or flushes. Anti-siphon valves mitigate free-flow if negative-pressure siphoning occurs.\n- Pump and line checks at handoffs/position changes: A structured “TIVA check” is critical at the moment of highest risk. Physically trace the line from patient to syringe; verify stopcock orientation, secure connections, correct pump program/alarms, and adequate syringe volume. Document “infusion running and verified.”\n- Monitoring adjuncts: Processed EEG (eg, BIS target 40–60) may aid detection but cannot guarantee hypnosis and should not substitute for delivery verification. Maintain audible pump alarms and low-volume warnings.\n\nCommon pitfalls highlighted by this case:\n- Mispositioned stopcocks or misconnections are frequent during handoffs and repositioning.\n- Pressurized fluids/flushes can displace or dilute hypnotic through shared connectors without distal check valves.\n- Adjusting opioid dose treats sympathetic signs but not the root cause (hypnotic interruption).\n\nPractical tip: Build a 10–15 second “TIVA pause” into every handoff/turn—announce and perform a line trace, confirm stopcocks, pump settings, and syringe volume; then resume.

Processed EEG (eg, BIS 40–60) reduces risk by providing a titration target, especially when neuromuscular blockade is used.\n- Hemodynamic instability/limited anesthetic dosing: Shock, massive hemorrhage, or concerns for uterine tone often lead clinicians to reduce volatile or hypnotic dose, increasing awareness risk. Neuromuscular blockade blunts movement and can mask inadequate hypnosis.\n- High‑risk populations/procedures: Obstetrics (emergent cesarean under GA) and cardiac surgery (particularly during CPB or sternotomy) have higher incidence due to urgency, physiologic instability, and sometimes intentional light anesthesia. Trauma and patients with high opioid/benzodiazepine tolerance or chronic alcohol use are also at risk.\n\nProtective factors and strategies:\n\n- Volatile anesthetics with adequate end‑tidal concentration (age‑adjusted MAC) provide reliable hypnosis; tracking end‑tidal agent is a major safety advantage.

Increasing sevoflurane to ET ~1.0% achieves ≈0.7–0.8 MAC and addresses both hypertension/tachycardia and awareness risk.\n\nKey points:\n- NMB removes the most sensitive clinical sign of inadequate hypnosis (movement), so rely on age-adjusted ET agent, hemodynamics, lacrimation, sweating, and pupillary responses.\n- Opioids primarily blunt nociception and reduce MAC for movement but are unreliable for amnesia; adequate hypnotic (volatile or propofol) is still required.\n- Processed EEG (eg, BIS) can be confounded by EMG and NMB; values in the \"target\" range do not guarantee amnesia if ET volatile is low.\n- When using volatiles, monitor age-adjusted MAC on the anesthesia machine and treat sustained sympathetic responses by increasing hypnotic depth rather than masking with antihypertensives alone.\n- End-tidal concentration approximates brain partial pressure once alveolar–brain equilibration occurs; increasing vaporizer setting to raise ET is the most direct way to deepen hypnosis.\n\nPractical tip: Enter the patient’s age into the monitor so the displayed MAC is age-adjusted, and set a low-agent alarm (eg, <0.5 MAC); if NMB is active, maintain ≥0.7 MAC unless contraindicated by hemodynamics.",

Hemodynamics often remain unchanged. The appropriate response is to recognize artifact, not to escalate hypnotic dosing.\n- EMG contamination: Facial/frontals muscle activity (light anesthesia, shivering, patient movement, forced-air warming) increases high-frequency power and falsely elevates the index.\n- Neuromuscular blockade: By suppressing facial EMG, NMB can lower the index independent of cortical hypnosis, sometimes into the 30s. This does not imply excessive hypnotic depth or burst suppression unless corroborated by the raw EEG.\n\nInterpret monitors in context: stable propofol/remifentanil dosing and unchanged hemodynamics argue against abrupt changes in cortical state. Always inspect the raw EEG and EMG indicators; a clean, slow-dominant EEG with minimal EMG supports true hypnosis, whereas high-frequency, saturating noise suggests artifact. \n\nOther notable confounders:\n- Ketamine and nitrous oxide can increase high-frequency EEG and the index despite adequate hypnosis/analgesia.\n- Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, severe hypotension, or cerebral ischemia can lower EEG power and the index (sometimes profoundly).\n- External devices (pacemakers, nerve stimulators) and poor electrode contact can distort readings.\n\nClinical implications:\n- Do not equate index changes with nociception; opioids primarily affect autonomic responses, not the hypnotic component measured by processed EEG.\n- Under TIVA, processed EEG is helpful but must be corroborated by raw EEG, drug dosing, and clinical signs to avoid both awareness and over-anesthetizing.\n\nPractical tip: When using processed EEG, trend the raw EEG and the EMG bar.

Under neuromuscular blockade, movement is absent, so physiologic and processed EEG cues are critical. End-tidal sevoflurane of 0.3% (~0.2 MAC for a mid-50s adult) is insufficient for surgical stimulation, particularly with paralysis.\n\nImmediate management priorities:\n\n- Restore hypnosis and analgesia quickly: a bolus of propofol (0.5–1 mg/kg) provides rapid unconsciousness; add an opioid (eg, fentanyl 1–2 μg/kg) for noxious stimuli.\n- Ensure adequate anesthetic delivery: raise fresh gas flow to 8–10 L/min and increase vaporizer output to speed alveolar rise; verify vaporizer on, ET agent monitoring, and circuit integrity. Alveolar kinetics follow $\\tau = V/\\text{FGF}$; with circuit volume ~6–8 L and FGF 0.5 L/min, $\\tau$ ≈ 12–16 min, so simply turning up the vaporizer at low flow is too slow.\n- Support hemodynamics: use a vasopressor (eg, phenylephrine, ephedrine) rather than a beta-blocker to treat hypotension/tachycardia so that adequate anesthetic can be delivered.\n- Consider a benzodiazepine after immediate control to provide anterograde amnesia; recognize it does not erase events already perceived.\n- Avoid increasing neuromuscular blockade to “control movement” without deepening anesthesia; paralysis masks signs and increases awareness risk.\n\nDocumentation and follow-up are essential: inform the team, minimize stimulation until depth is adequate, conduct a postoperative structured interview, document the event in the medical record, submit a safety/quality report, and arrange follow-up (and psychological support if needed).

Importantly, high-frequency facial EMG (approximately 70–110 Hz) is blended into the algorithm and tends to increase the number. Thus, factors that lower EMG can artifactually lower BIS even when cortical hypnosis is unchanged.\n\nNeuromuscular blockade eliminates facial EMG activity, often decreasing the BIS number shortly after administration. If anesthetic dosing is then reduced solely in response to the lower BIS, the patient may be placed at risk for awareness. Conversely, painful stimuli increase EMG and can transiently elevate BIS without a true change in cortical hypnotic state.

Technique matters: use volume control, suction secretions, set PEEP ≤5 cm H2O, ensure passive ventilation, deflate the cuff, and average several breaths. The leak volume or percentage can be calculated as: $Leak\\% = \\frac{V_{Tinsp} - V_{Texp}}{V_{Tinsp}} \\times 100\\%$. Typical thresholds suggesting safer extubation are leak volume >110 mL or leak >10–15% of V_T. Values below these cutoffs increase the risk of post-extubation stridor and reintubation.\n\nThis patient’s leak is 20 mL (4% of 500 mL), which strongly suggests clinically significant airway edema after anterior cervical surgery. Although the cuff leak test has high negative predictive value (a large leak makes stridor unlikely), its positive predictive value is modest—so management should integrate clinical context and risk factors (anterior cervical/thyroid surgery, prolonged intubation, traumatic intubation, high cuff pressure, large ETT, significant fluid shifts).\n\nWhen the cuff leak is absent or minimal, delaying extubation is prudent. Interventions include IV corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone 4–10 mg, repeat dosing may be considered), head-of-bed elevation, minimization of fluids, consideration of gentle diuresis if volume overloaded, and time for edema to regress. Reassess with a repeat cuff leak test in 2–4 hours. Nebulized epinephrine may transiently improve symptoms but is not a substitute for a safe airway strategy. Extubating over an airway exchange catheter does not correct fixed glottic narrowing and can still fail catastrophically.\n\nKey pitfalls producing false-low leaks include retained secretions, patient inspiratory effort, high PEEP, or mucus plugging. Address these before interpreting the test. If an urgent extubation is required despite a poor leak, be prepared with a difficult-airway plan and immediate reintubation capability.\n\nPractical tip: Before the cuff leak test, suction the subglottic and oropharyngeal spaces, set PEEP ≤5 cm H2O, ensure passive breaths, and average 6–8 breaths to stabilize the measured leak.",

After re-establishing two-lung ventilation, the priorities before extubation are to clear the airway and to open, then maintain, alveolar units.\n\nKey steps that reduce postoperative atelectasis and hypoxemia:\n- Remove secretions: Suction the trachea and oropharynx while intubated. Secretions/blood impede ventilation, increase shunt, and can seed distal collapse. Clearing them also improves the efficacy of recruitment maneuvers.\n- Recruit alveoli: A sustained inflation (eg, 30–40 cm $H_2O$ for 10–15 s) or a stepwise recruitment maneuver reopens atelectatic units by exceeding their opening pressures and shifting the pressure–volume curve. Recruitment improves V/Q matching and oxygenation.\n- Maintain end-expiratory patency: Apply and hold PEEP 8–10 cm $H_2O$ until extubation to prevent immediate recollapse (“open the lung, then keep it open”). If hemodynamics are tenuous, titrate PEEP and use shorter/lower-pressure recruitment while monitoring blood pressure and SpO2.\n- Preoxygenate with 100% $O_2$ prior to extubation to increase safety margin during the apneic phase. Although high $FiO_2$ can promote absorption atelectasis, this is offset by recruitment plus PEEP and the short duration of exposure.\n\nLess effective or harmful strategies:\n- Deep extubation prioritizes smooth emergence but sacrifices airway reflexes and secretion clearance, increasing obstruction and atelectasis risk.\n- Large tidal volumes do not reliably overcome opening pressures and increase volutrauma; sustained inflation is more efficient for recruitment.\n- Oxygen via nonrebreather after extubation lacks PEEP and does not address collapse already present.\n\nAfter extubation, consider CPAP/pressure support with PEEP in PACU, head-up positioning, and early incentive spirometry to maintain gains.\n\nPractical tip: Recruit only after confirming the operative lung has been re-expanded by the surgeon, and perform recruitment in brief increments while watching the arterial pressure and plateau pressure to avoid hypotension and barotrauma.",

    "didactic": "Obese patients with OSA are at high risk of postextubation airway obstruction and hypoxemia due to reduced functional residual capacity (FRC), elevated closing pressures, and heightened pharyngeal collapsibility. Supine positioning further decreases FRC, while residual neuromuscular blockade synergistically worsens upper-airway dilator muscle function. The safest strategy incorporates four pillars: complete reversal of neuromuscular block, awake extubation, head-up positioning, and immediate CPAP availability.\n\nKey points:\n- Use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring and ensure TOF ratio ≥0.9 (preferably ≥0.95 with acceleromyography) at the adductor pollicis before extubation. Qualitative fade or “strong grips” do not exclude clinically significant residual block.\n- Choose an appropriate reversal agent based on depth of block to achieve the target TOF ratio. Residual weakness increases airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and aspiration risk.\n- Extubate fully awake with intact airway reflexes. Deep extubation is generally unfavorable in OSA/obesity due to loss of pharyngeal tone and poor tolerance of obstruction.\n- Elevate the head of bed (~25–30°). Head-up positioning increases FRC and oxygen reserve, improving oxygenation at the moment of extubation when apnea or obstruction may occur.\n- Apply CPAP immediately postextubation, ideally using the patient’s home device and usual settings (commonly 8–12 cm $H_2O$). CPAP splints the upper airway and helps prevent atelectasis by maintaining alveolar recruitment.\n- Provide multimodal analgesia to limit opioids, which exacerbate hypoventilation and airway collapsibility. Titrate $FiO_2$ to the lowest level that maintains adequate saturation to avoid masking hypoventilation.\n\nCommon pitfalls include relying on qualitative TOF, extubating supine, performing deep extubation, and assuming a nasopharyngeal airway is equivalent to CPAP. Optimizing these steps reduces reintubation, PACU desaturation, and unplanned ICU admission in obese/OSA patients.\n\nPractical tip: Bring the patient’s CPAP to the OR and pretest it; elevate the head of bed before extubation, verify TOF ≥0.9 quantitatively, suction thoroughly, and extubate directly to the CPAP interface.",

When oxygenation allows, heliox and nebulized epinephrine provide rapid physiologic and pharmacologic relief while steroids reduce recurrence.\n\n- Heliox: A helium–oxygen mixture (70/30 or 80/20) lowers gas density, reducing turbulent flow and airway resistance in fixed and variable extrathoracic obstruction. Reynolds number: $Re \\propto \\dfrac{\\rho\\, v\\, D}{\\mu}$, where lowering density ($\\rho$) with helium decreases $Re$ and promotes more laminar flow. Heliox’s benefit is immediate and can improve aerosol delivery when used as the nebulizer driving gas.

Best practice includes:\n\n- Choose an appropriate AEC (eg, 11–14 Fr adult, hollow lumen) and lubricate.\n- Depth: position the tip just above the carina (roughly ETT depth minus 3–5 cm), confirmed by depth markings; avoid mainstem placement.\n- Technique: leave the AEC in situ while removing the ETT; secure the AEC to prevent migration, and keep full reintubation equipment immediately available.\n- Oxygenation: provide external oxygenation (eg, HFNC or tight facemask with CPAP) and, if desired, low-flow O2 insufflation via the AEC (about 1–2 L/min). This augments oxygenation with minimal pressure transmission.\n- Avoid high-pressure jet ventilation through the AEC in the extubation setting; with any glottic or supraglottic obstruction, gas trapping can cause pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or hemodynamic collapse. If jet ventilation is considered, it should be in a controlled setting with a known patent egress and immediate surgical airway capability.\n- Monitoring: continuous pulse oximetry and capnography (via facemask; some AECs allow CO2 sampling) help identify upper airway obstruction early.\n- Leave the AEC in place until airway patency is clearly stable (eg, comfortable, unobstructed breathing, reliable voice, sustained oxygenation without escalating support). Then remove it once the risk window has passed.\n\nKey risks of AECs include airway trauma if advanced too deep, coughing/bronchospasm, and barotrauma if pressurized ventilation is attempted without guaranteed egress.

Differentiate from bronchospasm (wheezing, prolonged expiration, present $ETCO_2$ tracing) because treatments differ.\n\nInitial management is prompt, stepwise: remove the stimulus and clear secretions/blood; apply a firm jaw thrust (Larson’s maneuver at the laryngospasm notch) and deliver continuous positive airway pressure (10–20 cm H2O) with 100% $O_2$ ($FiO_2$ 1.0). These measures can break partially occlusive spasm by splinting the glottis open and interrupting the reflex arc. If ineffective or if desaturation is rapid, escalate immediately to pharmacologic therapy.\n\nSmall doses of propofol (eg, 0.5–1 mg/kg IV) deepen anesthesia and may terminate laryngospasm, particularly when some leak is present. However, in complete spasm with falling saturation, the most reliable and rapid intervention is succinylcholine. Give 0.1–0.5 mg/kg IV (commonly 0.5 mg/kg) to promptly relax the laryngeal muscles; if IV access is lost, 4 mg/kg IM (or intralingual) can be used. After relaxation, ventilate with CPAP and reoxygenate; intubate if ongoing airway edema, bleeding, or repeated spasm is anticipated. Consider atropine in small children to mitigate succinylcholine-associated bradycardia.\n\nComplications include negative-pressure pulmonary edema from forceful inspiratory efforts against a closed glottis; treat with supplemental $O_2$, PEEP, and supportive care. Prevention focuses on adequate depth during stimulating phases, gentle suctioning, minimizing blood/secretions, and fully awake or truly deep extubation strategies.\n\nPractical tip: If CPAP + jaw thrust fails and the capnogram remains flat with SpO2 trending down, do not wait for nebulized therapies or more volatile—give succinylcholine immediately to break the spasm and restore ventilation.",

    "didactic": "Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring guides safe emergence. Depth of block is staged by the pattern of responses: deep block is defined by TOF count 0 with a measurable post-tetanic count (PTC). In this setting, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine) are unreliable because they have a ceiling effect and cannot effectively compete with substantial receptor occupancy. Instead, cyclodextrin encapsulation with sugammadex is indicated for steroidal neuromuscular blockers (rocuronium/vecuronium) and provides dose-dependent, rapid reversal.\n\nDose sugammadex to depth:\n- TOF count ≥2 (moderate block): 2 mg/kg.\n- TOF count 0 with PTC 1–2 (deep block): 4 mg/kg.\n- Immediate reversal after a large rocuronium dose (eg, can’t intubate/can’t ventilate): 16 mg/kg.\n\nExtubation should be delayed until quantitative TOF ratio (TOFR) is ≥0.9—and many advocate ≥0.95 to minimize pharyngeal dysfunction and aspiration risk. Clinical tests (sustained tetanus, 5-second head lift, strong handgrip) are insensitive; patients can often pass these with TOFR well below 0.9. Qualitative nerve stimulators cannot measure TOFR; acceleromyography or electromyography should be used when available.\n\nCommon pitfalls include giving neostigmine when the block is too deep (TOF count <4) or giving insufficient sugammadex (eg, 2 mg/kg for deep block), both leading to residual paralysis, hypoventilation, and upper airway obstruction. After reversal, confirm recovery with quantitative TOFR ≥0.9–0.95, ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and only then proceed to extubation.\n\nPractical tip: Calibrate the quantitative monitor after induction, position the transducer and preload appropriately, and warm the extremity—cold, poorly perfused hands and uncalibrated sensors produce misleading counts and ratios.",

Selection of agents should balance airway reflex suppression, hemodynamic control, and respiratory safety.\n\n- Dexmedetomidine (α2-agonist) provides sedation and analgesia-sparing effects with minimal respiratory depression. It reduces catecholamine release and airway reactivity, lowering cough incidence and blunting hypertension/tachycardia. A loading dose of 0.5–1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/h, is effective when started 10–15 minutes before extubation. Avoid rapid bolus to prevent transient hypertension/bradycardia.\n- IV lidocaine 1–1.5 mg/kg given 1–2 minutes pre-extubation decreases cough and laryngospasm but has modest and short-lived effects; mistimed dosing diminishes benefit and it does not reliably control hypertension.\n- Short-acting opioids (eg, remifentanil infusion 0.03–0.1 mcg/kg/min) can markedly reduce cough and blunt hemodynamics but carry real-time respiratory depression risk during emergence. Bolus dosing (eg, 1 mcg/kg) may cause chest wall rigidity and apnea. In OSA, prefer opioid-sparing strategies when alternatives can meet goals.\n- Ultra–short-acting β-blockers (eg, esmolol 0.5 mg/kg) attenuate tachycardia and hypertension without affecting respiratory drive but do not reliably suppress cough, so they are best as adjuncts when airway reflex control is already addressed.\n- Deep extubation reduces coughing but is unfavorable when blood/secretions are present (higher aspiration risk) and in OSA (airway obstruction risk).\n\nIn this OSA patient with anticipated 10 minutes to extubation and bleeding risk, a timed dexmedetomidine load best targets both cough and hypertension while preserving ventilation. Lidocaine could be added just before extubation if cough remains a concern, and esmolol may be layered if sympathetic tone persists.\n\nPractical tip: Confirm full neuromuscular reversal, suction meticulously, and time agents carefully—dexmedetomidine load 10–15 minutes before extubation and IV lidocaine 1–2 minutes before tube removal optimize smooth emergence.",

    "didactic": "Selecting deep versus awake extubation balances aspiration risk, airway reactivity, and surgical priorities. Deep extubation (removing the ETT under adequate inhalational anesthesia with preserved spontaneous ventilation) reduces coughing, bucking, and expiratory flow spikes that can cause bleeding or graft disruption (eg, nasal, middle ear, ophthalmic surgery) and may lessen bronchospasm in reactive airways. However, it increases the risk of upper airway obstruction and aspiration if protective reflexes are depressed.\n\nAwake extubation is preferred when aspiration risk is elevated or airway patency may be tenuous: full stomach, significant GERD/hiatal hernia, pregnancy, morbid obesity/OSA, prolonged difficult airway, or ongoing airway bleeding/secretions. In airway surgery with edema or uncertain leak, the safest strategy is typically fully awake extubation after meticulous suctioning and confirmation of adequate ventilation.\n\nIn this case, the patient is fasted with no GERD, has minimal blood after throat-pack removal and suctioning, and has reactive airways in whom coughing can precipitate bronchospasm. The surgeon’s priority is to avoid cough-induced epistaxis. These conditions favor deep extubation with preserved spontaneous ventilation. Practical steps include ensuring adequate anesthetic depth (eg, ~1.2 MAC sevoflurane), thorough oropharyngeal suctioning, removal at end-expiration, and immediate airway support (jaw thrust, oral airway, CPAP as needed) while the patient transitions to a patent airway and stable ventilation.\n\nMeasures to reduce cough during awake extubation (IV lidocaine 1–1.5 mg/kg, short-acting opioids, dexmedetomidine, esmolol) can mitigate but not abolish coughing and are less reliable when cough avoidance is critical. Exchanging to an LMA adds instrumentation and does not eliminate aspiration risk from residual blood.\n\nKey points:\n- Choose awake extubation for high aspiration risk or questionable airway patency.\n- Consider deep extubation for low aspiration risk, high cough cost (ENT/ear/eye), or reactive airways.\n- Always suction thoroughly and confirm removal of pharyngeal packs before any extubation.\n\nPractical tip: For deep extubation, remove the ETT at end-expiration and be ready with jaw thrust and an oral airway; continued gentle CPAP can help maintain patency until reflexes return.",

Avoid $N_2O$, which increases PONV and can worsen the surgical field via venodilation.\n- Emergence/bleeding: Remifentanil allows tight control of hemodynamics for a dry field and facilitates a smooth, cough-minimizing emergence—critical to prevent postextubation epistaxis or hematoma. Volatile agents (particularly desflurane) can increase airway reactivity and cough.\n- Comorbidities/hemodynamics: Propofol and volatile agents both permit controlled hypotension; remifentanil offers precise titration and rapid offset. Balance hypotension targets (eg, MAP 60–65 mm Hg) against patient factors (eg, cerebrovascular disease).\n- Monitoring requirements: Without end-tidal MAC as an index, TIVA should be titrated with a processed EEG (eg, BIS 40–60) to reduce awareness risk, especially with neuromuscular blockade. Use effect-site targeting when available and confirm adequate analgesia (hemodynamics, surgical conditions).\n\nComparison:\n- Volatile + remifentanil at low MAC can work but is inferior when repeated apnea is planned and provides less PONV reduction than propofol TIVA.\n- Desflurane/LMA is ill-suited for a bloody, shared airway and increases coughing.\n- Opioid-free TIVA with dexmedetomidine may be insufficient for intense sinus stimulation and can delay emergence.\n\nPractical tip: For ESS, pair propofol–remifentanil TIVA with multimodal antiemetics, avoid $N_2O$, target BIS 40–60, and taper remifentanil near the end while administering non-opioid analgesics to blunt rebound hyperalgesia.",

    "didactic": "Reactive airways benefit from anesthetics that blunt vagal reflexes and directly relax airway smooth muscle. Volatile agents (sevoflurane, isoflurane) are reliable intraoperative bronchodilators via airway smooth muscle relaxation and attenuation of reflex bronchoconstriction. Desflurane is pungent and airway-irritating, increasing resistance—especially in smokers and asthmatics—through trigeminal/TRPA1 activation and vagal reflexes. In acute intraoperative bronchospasm, promptly removing the irritant and deepening with a bronchodilating volatile is effective.\n\nRapid delivery matters. Raising fresh gas flow lowers the circle system time constant ($\\tau = V/FGF$), accelerating the rise of alveolar anesthetic fraction relative to inspired concentration ($F_A/F_I$). Increasing FGF to 6–8 L/min speeds end-tidal sevoflurane to 1.0–1.3 MAC within minutes, producing clinically meaningful bronchodilation. Pair with 100% oxygen, manual ventilation to assess compliance, and short-acting inhaled $\\beta_2$-agonists via the circuit. In severe cases, small-dose epinephrine may be needed.\n\nTotal intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is a strong alternative when inhaled agents are contraindicated (eg, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, severe hemodynamic instability with volatiles, circuit contamination concerns). Propofol provides bronchodilation (reduced cholinergic tone) but less predictably than sevoflurane for acute bronchospasm. Ketamine (0.2–0.5 mg/kg/hr after a small bolus) offers bronchodilation via catecholamine release and direct smooth muscle effects and is useful when hypotension limits volatile or propofol dosing. Remifentanil decreases airway reflexes and sympathetic surges that can trigger bronchospasm.\n\nVentilatory strategy supports but does not replace bronchodilation: use low $V_T$ (6–8 mL/kg IBW), low–moderate respiratory rate with prolonged expiratory time, and cautious PEEP (or minimal PEEP) to avoid dynamic hyperinflation. Treat triggers (light anesthesia, secretions, endobronchial intubation) and avoid histamine-releasing drugs.\n\nPractical tip: In asthmatics maintained on desflurane who develop wheeze and a “shark-fin” capnogram, immediately switch to sevoflurane and increase FGF to rapidly raise end-tidal concentration, while administering inhaled albuterol through the circuit.",

    "didactic": "TIVA depends entirely on continuous IV drug delivery, making it vulnerable to failures of pumps, power, and IV patency. Unlike volatile anesthesia, there is no end-tidal surrogate confirming delivery; therefore, prevention of delivery interruption is paramount. Plugging syringe pumps into red emergency outlets ensures they draw from generator-backed power during a transfer. Verifying internal battery charge and self-test status adds a second layer of redundancy if the outlet fails or the pole is briefly unplugged.\n\nIV setup should further minimize interruption risk: dedicate a well-secured IV to the anesthetic infusions, avoid placing an NIBP cuff or restrictive positioning on that limb, and use short, low-dead-space tubing with the drug Y-site as proximal to the patient as feasible. Large tubing volumes create significant delays and rebound effects: the delivery time constant is approximately $\\tau = V / Q$, where $V$ is the volume between pump and bloodstream and $Q$ is the infusion flow (mL/min). For example, 10 mL of tubing volume with a 12 mL/h (0.2 mL/min) propofol infusion yields $\\tau \\approx 50$ minutes—far too sluggish for titration and prone to unintended boluses when rates change.\n\nMonitoring (capnography, hemodynamics, and processed EEG) is recommended but should be viewed as detection, not prevention. In the event of pump failure or power loss, immediate manual boluses (eg, propofol 0.5–1 mg/kg) bridge hypnosis while reconnecting to emergency power and restarting infusions. Keep prefilled backup syringes available. For maintenance, propofol infusions commonly range 75–150 mcg/kg/min, with remifentanil 0.05–0.2 mcg/kg/min; plan the emergence by stopping remifentanil 5–10 minutes before closure and tapering propofol guided by clinical signs and EEG, considering context-sensitive half-times.\n\nOther safety steps: use anti-siphon/check valves to prevent backflow, label the TIVA line clearly, have a second IV for fluids/vasopressors, and document pump settings/alarms. \n\nPractical tip: Before induction, briefly unplug each pump to confirm it transitions to battery without stopping, then plug into the red outlet and note expected battery runtime.",

For patients at high PONV risk (eg, female, nonsmoker, prior PONV), propofol-based TIVA consistently reduces PONV compared with volatile anesthesia. Avoiding $N_2O$ further lowers PONV and bowel distention risk. In ambulatory laparoscopic surgery, these choices directly improve readiness for discharge.\n\nOpioid minimization is central. Use short-acting intraoperative opioids (eg, remifentanil) only as needed and pair them with multimodal, nonopioid analgesia to avoid large postoperative opioid requirements. Effective components include:\n- Acetaminophen (eg, 1 g IV/PO) and an NSAID (eg, ketorolac 15 mg IV) unless contraindicated.\n- Surgeon-performed local infiltration or a regional block (eg, port-site infiltration or TAP block).\n- Consider low-dose ketamine, IV lidocaine, or magnesium in select cases to decrease central sensitization and opioid consumption.\n\nVolatile anesthetics (even at reduced MAC) increase PONV relative to propofol TIVA. Desflurane facilitates quick wake-up but does not confer the PONV advantage of TIVA. Long-acting opioids (morphine, hydromorphone) increase PONV and can delay discharge; they are generally avoided in ERAS ambulatory pathways. Dexmedetomidine can lower opioid use but may cause bradycardia and sedation that delay PACU throughput; it should be used judiciously and typically as an adjunct rather than the primary strategy in high PONV–risk ambulatory cases.\n\nHigh-risk PONV patients should receive multimodal prophylaxis from different classes (eg, ondansetron + dexamethasone ± droperidol) in addition to selecting TIVA and avoiding $N_2O$ and long-acting opioids.\n\nPractical tip: For a 60-minute laparoscopic case, a propofol infusion (eg, 75–125 mcg/kg/min) with remifentanil (eg, 0.05–0.1 mcg/kg/min), scheduled acetaminophen and ketorolac, surgeon local infiltration, and two antiemetic classes provides reliable analgesia and minimal PONV while supporting same-day discharge.",

It has a very small and duration-independent CSHT of ~3–5 minutes, even after many hours. Because effect wanes rapidly, analgesia is lost quickly; without bridging (eg, hydromorphone, fentanyl, ketamine, acetaminophen, NSAIDs, regional/neuraxial), patients can awaken in severe pain with sympathetic surges.\n- **Propofol**: Highly lipophilic hypnotic with multicompartment kinetics. Early offset is dominated by redistribution, but with prolonged infusions, peripheral compartments fill, reducing the gradient for redistribution back to plasma. As duration increases, CSHT lengthens (commonly tens of minutes after several hours), so emergence becomes slower and less predictable compared with brief cases.\n\nClinical implications for emergence planning:\n- If both infusions are turned off simultaneously near the end of a long case, **remifentanil will wear off first**, restoring respiratory drive but removing analgesia; **propofol may still provide hypnosis/sedation** for additional minutes.

Their impact depends on agent choice, fresh gas flow (FGF), case duration, and scavenging. Global warming potential over 100 years (GWP100) and atmospheric lifetime rank roughly as: desflurane (GWP ≈2500; ~10 years) >> isoflurane (≈510; ~3 years) > sevoflurane (≈130; ~1 year). $N_2O$ has GWP ≈298 with a very long lifetime (~114 years) and also depletes ozone. Consequently, avoiding desflurane and $N_2O$ yields large reductions.\n\nFGF directly determines volatile consumption; a useful approximation is: mL liquid anesthetic used per hour ≈ 3 × FGF (L/min) × vol%. Thus, lowering FGF from 2 to 1 L/min halves agent consumption and emissions at a given end-tidal concentration. Low-flow (0.5–1 L/min) anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane markedly reduces footprint when volatiles are needed. However, TIVA eliminates halogenated agent emissions entirely and generally has the lowest greenhouse impact despite its life-cycle considerations (drug manufacture, plastics), which are comparatively small versus volatile release.\n\nScavenging protects staff by removing waste gases from the OR, but standard systems vent outside; they do not abate greenhouse emissions. Total mass released is what matters climatically, so strategies that prevent generation (eg, TIVA) or reduce consumption (eg, low-flow volatile) are most effective. Emerging volatile-capture technologies may further mitigate emissions but are not yet widespread.\n\nPractical implications:\n- Prefer TIVA when clinically appropriate; avoid routine $N_2O$ and desflurane.\n- If using volatiles, employ low-flow anesthesia (≈0.5–1 L/min) and avoid unnecessary high FGF periods.\n- Keep scavenging on to protect personnel; it does not substitute for emission reduction.\n\nPractical tip: Start with high FGF only for brief wash-in, then promptly reduce to low-flow; turn off flows during apneic periods (eg, intubation) and avoid $N_2O$ to achieve large, low-effort emission cuts.",

Balanced anesthesia mitigates hypotension by reducing the hypnotic requirement and supplementing with opioid/adjunct analgesia, while using vasoactive support tailored to the hemodynamic profile.\n\nKey physiology: $MAP \\approx CO \\times SVR$. Propofol primarily decreases SVR and can depress myocardial contractility; remifentanil provides potent analgesia with minimal direct vasodilation. When BIS is low (eg, 30–40), excessive hypnotic depth is likely contributing to hypotension.\n\nPractical approach in this scenario:\n- Lighten the hypotension-provoking agent (propofol) to reduce vasodilation and negative inotropy.\n- Increase the opioid (eg, remifentanil) to maintain surgical tolerance, especially during pneumoperitoneum, allowing a lower hypnotic dose.\n- Use a vasopressor aligned with the physiology: phenylephrine (50–100 mcg bolus; consider infusion) is preferred when hypotension coexists with normal/high HR, as it raises SVR without further tachycardia. Ephedrine (5–10 mg) is more useful when hypotension is accompanied by bradycardia or low CO states.\n\nTypical ranges: propofol TIVA 100–200 mcg/kg/min; remifentanil 0.05–0.2 mcg/kg/min. Volatile MAC can be reduced by 30–60% with adequate opioid or adjuncts (eg, ketamine, dexmedetomidine), improving hemodynamic stability.\n\nCommon pitfalls include treating anesthetic-induced vasodilation with fluids alone, deepening anesthesia in response to surgical stimulation despite hypotension, and choosing ephedrine in tachycardic patients where alpha-predominant support is safer.\n\nPractical tip: Address hypotension with a triad—lighten the offending anesthetic, add/sustain analgesia to prevent movement, and apply vasoactive support chosen by HR/CO vs SVR pattern—while tracking depth (BIS), ventilation, and blood loss to avoid chasing the wrong cause.",

Propofol delivery can be silently interrupted by upstream connections, long dead space, mispositioned stopcocks, infiltrated IVs, or disconnections—conditions that may not trigger occlusion alarms (which detect high, not low, downstream pressure). A sudden rise in processed EEG into the 60–70 range under neuromuscular blockade, without hemodynamic change (blunted by opioid), should prompt immediate restoration of hypnosis.\n\nThe quickest way to reestablish adequate hypnotic effect is a bolus of propofol via verified patent IV access, then resecure continuous delivery. Move the infusion to a dedicated IV line or a distal Y-site closest to the patient to minimize dead space and unpredictability. Use a validated regimen (eg, TCI with effect-site targeting using Schnider/Marsh models) rather than ad hoc carrier-flow strategies. Incorporate an initial loading bolus to rapidly achieve the desired effect-site concentration; the effect-site equilibration half-time for propofol ($t_{1/2\\,ke0}$) is ~1.5–2 minutes, whereas remifentanil’s is ~1 minute.\n\nProcessed EEG is valuable when NMB is used because motor signs are absent; target 40–60 and interpret intelligently (avoid artifact from cautery, warming, or EMG). Opioids (eg, remifentanil) treat nociception but do not ensure hypnosis, and more NMB only masks movement, increasing undetected awareness risk. Benzodiazepines may reduce explicit recall but are neither rapid nor sufficient to correct active underdosing.\n\nBest practices to prevent awareness during TIVA:\n- Use validated infusion regimens (eg, effect-site TCI) and drug libraries with hard limits.\n- Provide a loading bolus; then titrate to processed EEG 40–60.\n- Employ a dedicated IV line or a distal port; minimize long manifolds and dead space.\n- Perform frequent line tracing and pump checks, especially after bag/syringe changes.\n- Treat any suspected light anesthesia with an immediate hypnotic bolus while troubleshooting.\n\nPractical tip: If processed EEG rises unexpectedly under paralysis, assume inadequate hypnosis first—give a propofol bolus via confirmed IV, then find and fix the delivery problem.",

    "didactic": "Volatile anesthetics and propofol have opposing effects on the cerebral circulation that are critical in neurosurgery. Volatiles (sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane) decrease $CMRO_2$ but also produce direct cerebral vasodilation. As dose increases (≈≥1 MAC), vasodilation predominates, increasing CBF and cerebral blood volume (CBV), which raises ICP—especially in patients with reduced intracranial compliance. Volatiles also dose-dependently blunt cerebral autoregulation, making CBF more pressure-passive. $CO_2$ reactivity is generally preserved up to ≈1 MAC but may be attenuated at higher doses.\n\nPropofol reduces $CMRO_2$ and causes cerebral vasoconstriction, lowering CBF, CBV, and ICP. Importantly, propofol preserves autoregulation and $CO_2$ reactivity, allowing predictable control of CBF via $PaCO_2$ adjustments. This profile makes propofol-based maintenance (TIVA) or a low-volatile technique (≤0.5 MAC) supplemented with propofol/opioid advantageous when brain relaxation is paramount and neurophysiologic monitoring is needed.\n\n$N_2O$ increases both $CMRO_2$ and CBF and can raise ICP; it is generally avoided in intracranial mass lesions or when brain swelling is a concern.\n\nKey relationships:\n- $CPP = MAP - ICP$. Lowering ICP improves CPP without increasing MAP. If autoregulation is impaired (eg, higher MAC volatile), raising MAP can increase CBF/CBV and worsen ICP.\n- $PaCO_2$ reduction causes cerebral vasoconstriction and decreases ICP; avoid prolonged extreme hyperventilation (eg, $PaCO_2$ <30 mm Hg) due to ischemia risk.\n\nPractical implications for a “tight” brain after dural opening:\n- Eliminate vasodilatory drivers: stop $N_2O$, reduce volatile to ≤0.5 MAC.\n- Initiate propofol infusion to lower $CMRO_2$/CBF and preserve autoregulation/$CO_2$ reactivity.\n- Maintain mild hypocapnia (ET$CO_2$ ≈30–35 mm Hg) and optimize positioning/venous outflow.\n\nPractical tip: When brain relaxation is critical, use propofol-based maintenance and limit volatile to ≤0.5 MAC; this improves ICP control and keeps neuromonitoring interpretable while preserving the ability to titrate CBF with $PaCO_2$.

    ],
    "didactic": "Residual neuromuscular blockade (rNMB) is common after intermediate-acting aminosteroid NMBAs (e.g., rocuronium, vecuronium) and is strongly associated with hypoxemia, airway obstruction, impaired swallowing, and aspiration. Clinical signs (head lift, grip) and qualitative peripheral nerve stimulation are unreliable; even with 4 visible twitches, significant fade can persist. Quantitative monitoring (acceleromyography) provides an objective train-of-four ratio (TOFR). Extubation should occur only when TOFR ≥0.9 (many advocate ≥0.95 for airway safety). A PACU TOFR of 0.45 at the adductor pollicis reflects substantial residual block.\n\nReversal strategy depends on block depth and drug used:\n- Neostigmine increases acetylcholine but has a ceiling effect and is less effective when block is deeper than moderate. It may be ineffective when TOFR is low despite TOF count of 4. Redosing shortly after a full dose adds side effects (bradycardia, secretions) without predictable benefit.\n- Sugammadex encapsulates rocuronium/vecuronium, rapidly reversing even moderate-to-deep block. For moderate block (≥T2 present or TOFR with 4 twitches but <0.9), 2 mg/kg typically restores TOFR ≥0.9 within 2–3 minutes. For deeper block (post-tetanic count 1–2 and no TOF), use 4 mg/kg; for immediate reversal after RSI, 16 mg/kg.\n\nManagement priorities in PACU:\n- Recognize rNMB with quantitative TOF (bulbar weakness, diplopia, dysphagia are clues).\n- Provide airway support and assisted ventilation with 100% O2 to correct hypoventilation while administering the appropriate reversal agent.\n- Confirm recovery with quantitative TOFR ≥0.9–0.95 before discontinuing support.\n\nSpecial case: rNMB from succinylcholine or mivacurium (e.g., pseudocholinesterase deficiency) is not reversible with neostigmine or sugammadex; provide mechanical ventilation and sedation until spontaneous recovery.\n\nPractical tip: If PACU TOFR <0.9 after aminosteroid NMBAs, treat as rNMB—support ventilation immediately and give sugammadex based on depth; do not rely on “breathing trials,” CPAP alone, or additional neostigmine.",

The key is to use exam, capnography/ABG, and response to O2.\n\n- Hypoventilation: Elevated PaCO2 with a normal A–a gradient; PaO2 rises appropriately on 100% O2. Alveolar gas equation: $P_{AO_2} = FiO_2\\,(P_B - P_{H_2O}) - \\dfrac{PaCO_2}{R}$. On 100% O2 at sea level: $P_{AO_2} \\approx 713 - 1.25\\,PaCO_2$.\n- Shunt/atelectasis: Increased A–a gradient and poor response to 100% O2. Obesity, OSA, and pneumoperitoneum promote dependent atelectasis. Treatment is recruitment with CPAP/PEEP.\n- Pulmonary edema: Rales, pink frothy sputum, and CXR findings; manage with PEEP and diuresis if cardiogenic. Negative-pressure edema follows acute upper-airway obstruction.\n- Pulmonary embolism: Acute V–Q mismatch with increased dead space; ETCO2 often falls and the PaCO2–ETCO2 gap widens. Patients are often tachypneic and hypocapnic early.\n\nIn this case, after 5 minutes on 100% O2, PaO2 is 88 mm Hg with PaCO2 60 mm Hg. Using the equation: $P_{AO_2} = 713 - 1.25\\times 60 \\approx 638$ mm Hg, so A–a gradient is roughly 550 mm Hg—markedly elevated—indicating shunt from atelectasis rather than isolated hypoventilation. Decreased basilar breath sounds and obesity/OSA further support atelectasis. The most effective immediate therapy is CPAP/PEEP (eg, CPAP 10 cm H2O with high $FiO_2$) to reopen dependent, collapsed alveoli and improve V–Q matching.\n\nNaloxone may help hypercapnia if opioid-induced hypoventilation is significant, but it will not correct a large shunt and may precipitate severe pain and sympathetic surge. Diuretics are reserved for pulmonary edema; bronchodilators for bronchospasm. Imaging for PE should not delay corrective respiratory support when atelectasis is likely.\n\nPractical tip: In PACU hypoxemia, first ensure airway patency and high $FiO_2$, then calculate the A–a gradient; a large gradient with poor response to O2 points to shunt—treat with PEEP/CPAP and recruitment maneuvers.",

    "didactic": "Emergence delirium in adults typically occurs within minutes of arrival to PACU and presents as inattention, disorientation, and agitation. Common precipitants include untreated pain, hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypotension, urinary retention, and deliriogenic drugs (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, meperidine). Initial steps are to ensure oxygenation/ventilation (SpO2, $ETCO_2$, RR), check glucose, and rapidly assess/treat pain.\n\nFirst-line management of hyperactive emergence delirium is nonpharmacologic reorientation plus analgesia. Calm verbal reassurance, visible clocks, glasses/hearing aids, and family presence (when feasible) reduce fear and disorientation. Pain exacerbates sympathetic activation and delirium; give small, titrated IV opioids (eg, fentanyl 25–50 mcg or hydromorphone 0.2–0.4 mg) and employ multimodal adjuncts (acetaminophen, NSAIDs if appropriate, regional blocks).\n\nAvoid benzodiazepines unless treating alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal—they increase postoperative delirium and can cause paradoxical agitation. Minimize other deliriogenic agents (anticholinergics, diphenhydramine, meperidine). If agitation remains unsafe after analgesia and reorientation, consider dexmedetomidine for cooperative sedation (sympatholysis without respiratory depression) or small doses of antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV, monitor QTc and extrapyramidal effects). Propofol may transiently control severe agitation but does not treat delirium and risks airway compromise.\n\nHypoactive delirium presents with quiet confusion, inattention, and fluctuating alertness; it is easily mistaken for residual sedation. Management focuses on reorientation, sleep-wake normalization, early mobilization, and adequate analgesia—undertreated pain is common. Screen with tools such as CAM-ICU or 4AT and target light sedation (RASS −1 to 0) if ongoing sedation is required.\n\nKey points:\n- Rule out/treat physiologic triggers (hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, urinary retention).\n- Prioritize reorientation and analgesia; avoid benzodiazepines when possible.\n- Use dexmedetomidine or antipsychotics for refractory, unsafe agitation; monitor for adverse effects.\n\nPractical tip: In PACU, pair a quick delirium screen with a pain assessment; if $ETCO_2$ and oxygenation are adequate, treat pain first and reorient before adding sedatives.",

    "didactic": "Multimodal analgesia and careful monitoring reduce opioid requirements and respiratory depression in high‑risk patients (eg, OSA, obesity). For PCA in opioid‑naïve adults, typical demand doses are morphine 1 mg or hydromorphone 0.1–0.2 mg with 6–10‑min lockouts; avoid routine basal infusions in opioid‑naïve or OSA patients due to increased risk of hypoventilation and apnea. A basal rate removes the negative feedback inherent to patient‑controlled dosing (patients who get sedated stop pressing), allowing drug accumulation during sleep.\n\nContinuous respiratory monitoring is crucial. On supplemental $O_2$, $SpO_2$ may remain normal despite significant hypoventilation. Capnography ($ETCO_2$ via nasal sampling) detects reduced minute ventilation and apnea earlier than pulse oximetry, enabling timely intervention. Because oversedation precedes respiratory depression, structured sedation scoring (eg, Pasero Opioid‑Induced Sedation Scale) at regular intervals is recommended, with holding parameters for excessive sedation.\n\nNonopioid adjuncts, when not contraindicated, provide opioid‑sparing effects: IV/PO acetaminophen and NSAIDs (eg, ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h) reduce pain scores and total opioid dose without increasing sedation. Contraindications to NSAIDs include renal insufficiency, active bleeding, high bleeding risk, peptic ulcer disease, and some surgical preferences; in low‑risk laparoscopic cases, they are typically appropriate. Avoid adding other centrally sedating agents (eg, benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, high‑dose gabapentinoids) in OSA patients early post‑op.\n\nHydromorphone demand 0.2 mg with a 10‑min lockout provides titratable analgesia. Omitting a basal rate and combining continuous capnography (when on $O_2$), continuous $SpO_2$, and scheduled sedation assessments balances efficacy and safety. Ensure PCA education (no PCA by proxy), smart‑pump limits, and readily available naloxone for titrated reversal (eg, 0.04 mg IV increments) if oversedation occurs.\n\nPractical tip: In any patient on supplemental $O_2$ receiving PCA, add nasal capnography—normal $SpO_2$ does not exclude hypoventilation; trends in $ETCO_2$ and waveform quality are your earliest warning.",

    "didactic": "Postoperative hypotension is best approached by categorizing the physiology using $MAP = CO \\times SVR$. Thoracic epidurals can cause sympathectomy, reducing arteriolar SVR and venous tone, which lowers venous return (preload) by shifting blood to the venous capacitance (unstressed volume). Clinically, distributive physiology presents with warm, flushed extremities, brisk capillary refill, and absence of pulmonary congestion. The temporal link to an epidural local anesthetic bolus and a mid-thoracic sensory level further supports neuraxial sympathectomy.\n\nInitial management targets the dominant abnormality. For vasodilation from neuraxial block, an α1-agonist (phenylephrine 50–200 mcg IV bolus) rapidly restores SVR and venous tone, improving venous return and MAP. Reducing or temporarily stopping the epidural local anesthetic mitigates ongoing sympathectomy; continue opioid-only epidural analgesia if needed. A modest crystalloid bolus can be added if there is clinical concern for relative preload reduction, but fluids alone are often insufficient and delay correction.\n\nHypovolemia (bleeding or under-resuscitation) typically manifests as cool, clammy skin, narrowed pulse pressure, tachycardia, and flat neck veins; management prioritizes balanced crystalloid or blood products guided by clinical context and labs. Cardiogenic hypotension (e.g., perioperative MI, decompensated heart failure) presents with cool extremities, elevated JVP, pulmonary rales/B-lines, and often new ECG changes; management involves inotropes (e.g., dobutamine 2–10 mcg/kg/min) and cautious fluids, with prompt cardiology evaluation.\n\nEphedrine (5–10 mg IV) is useful for hypotension with relative bradycardia due to its mixed α/β and indirect effects, but it is less appropriate in tachycardic, vasodilated states and can cause tachyphylaxis. Push-dose epinephrine (5–20 mcg IV) is reserved for peri-arrest or profound distributive shock when immediate escalation is required.\n\nPractical tip: If available, a quick passive leg raise or focused cardiac/IVC-lung ultrasound can distinguish fluid responsiveness (preload deficit) from vasodilation or pump failure within minutes, allowing targeted therapy.",

    "didactic": "Postanesthetic shivering is common after general and neuraxial anesthesia due to impaired thermoregulation and core-to-peripheral heat redistribution. Shivering increases whole-body oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (often 100%–200% above baseline), elevates sympathetic tone (tachycardia, hypertension), and can worsen myocardial ischemia and hypoxemia in vulnerable patients. Management goals are to restore thermal balance and promptly suppress the thermoregulatory drive to shiver.\n\nKey steps:\n- Assess oxygenation/ventilation and analgesia; provide supplemental O2 and treat pain if present.\n- Initiate active warming: forced-air warming is most effective in PACU; warmed blankets are adjuncts. Warmed IV fluids add minimal heat unless large volumes are infused.\n- Use targeted pharmacologic therapy when shivering persists or rapid suppression is needed.\n\nMeperidine is the most effective single agent for postanesthetic shivering. Low IV doses (12.5–25 mg) typically abolish shivering within minutes by lowering the shivering threshold, likely via $\u0003ba$-opioid and $\u0003b1_2$ mechanisms distinct from pure $\u0003bc$-opioid analgesia. At these doses, respiratory depression is uncommon, but monitor for sedation. Avoid meperidine in patients with severe renal impairment (normeperidine accumulation/seizure risk) or with MAO inhibitors/serotonergic drugs (serotonin toxicity risk).\n\nAlpha-2 agonists (clonidine, dexmedetomidine) also reduce shivering by decreasing central sympathetic outflow and shifting thermoregulatory thresholds but have slower onset (PO clonidine) and greater risks of hypotension/bradycardia and sedation—less desirable for rapid, short-lived PACU needs. Other agents with evidence include tramadol and magnesium, but they are not as consistently effective as meperidine.\n\nPractical tip: Combine forced-air warming with meperidine 12.5–25 mg IV for rapid control; reassess temperature, oxygenation, and hemodynamics, and discontinue pharmacologic therapy once shivering resolves.",

It does not produce sustained muscle contracture, marked CK elevation, or refractory hypercarbia when ventilation is adequate.\n\nImmediate MH management:\n- Stop all triggers; switch to 100% $O_2$ and aggressively hyperventilate.\n- Give dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV, repeat as needed (up to 10 mg/kg) until $ETCO_2$, rigidity, and HR improve.\n- Active cooling, treat acidosis (e.g., bicarbonate for severe acidosis), and manage hyperkalemia (insulin/dextrose; avoid calcium channel blockers with dantrolene).

    "didactic": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is driven by multiple receptor pathways (5-HT3, D2, H1, muscarinic, NK1). When prophylaxis fails, rescue therapy should target a different receptor class than those already used. After intraoperative dexamethasone (steroid) and ondansetron (5-HT3 antagonist), the next step is a dopamine antagonist such as a butyrophenone.\n\nLow-dose haloperidol (0.5–1 mg IV) is an effective rescue antiemetic with minimal sedation and hemodynamic impact. Its primary action is D2 antagonism at the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Onset is within minutes, and it is suitable for ambulatory settings when rapid control without excess sedation is desired. Monitor for QT prolongation and rare extrapyramidal symptoms; risk is low at these doses but increases in the presence of prolonged QT, electrolyte abnormalities, or interacting drugs. Droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg IV) is similarly effective but carries a boxed warning for QT prolongation; either agent requires QT awareness.\n\nCommon rescue pitfalls include:\n- Repeating a 5-HT3 antagonist shortly after prophylaxis, which offers limited incremental benefit within 6 hours.\n- Choosing agents with delayed onset (eg, transdermal scopolamine), which are better for prophylaxis in high-risk patients or for delayed PONV.\n- Relying on metoclopramide 10 mg IV, which is less effective for established, refractory PONV compared with butyrophenones.\n- Using propofol boluses, which may briefly relieve symptoms but are short-acting and sedating, complicating discharge readiness.\n\nRisk factors in this case (female sex, nonsmoker, laparoscopic surgery, postoperative opioids) increase PONV risk; multimodal prophylaxis is appropriate, but failures still occur. Effective rescue uses a different class, addresses reversible contributors (eg, opioids), and considers safety (QT, sedation).\n\nPractical tip: Document prophylaxis classes given; for early PACU rescue after ondansetron/dexamethasone, give haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV (or droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV if QT allows), correct electrolytes, reduce opioids if feasible, and provide IV fluids.",

If obstruction persists or immediately recurs when manual maneuvers are released—especially in patients with OSA—apply CPAP via a tight-fitting mask to pneumatically splint the pharyngeal airway. Typical PACU settings are 5–10 cm $H_2O$ with supplemental oxygen, titrated to effect. Using the patient’s home CPAP settings is reasonable if known and tolerated.\n\nIncreasing $FiO_2$ alone does not treat the obstruction and risks masking progressive hypoventilation. Naloxone is appropriate for clear opioid-induced hypoventilation (eg, apnea, bradypnea with hypoventilation) but is not first-line for mechanical obstruction and should be titrated in small doses (eg, 20–40 mcg) if used to avoid pain/sympathetic surge. Reintubation is reserved for failure of noninvasive measures, inability to maintain ventilation/oxygenation, or deteriorating mental status.\n\nKey points:\n- Obstruction: reduced upper-airway tone → dynamic pharyngeal collapse.\n- Stepwise therapy: reposition → jaw thrust → oral/nasal airway → CPAP (5–10 cm $H_2O$) → reintubate if failing.\n- Oxygenation without airway patency is insufficient and potentially misleading.\n\nPractical tip: In known OSA, have CPAP readily available in the PACU; apply CPAP early when obstruction recurs after releasing a jaw thrust, and monitor closely for gastric insufflation and patient tolerance.",

In these settings, multi-modal prophylaxis using agents with different mechanisms is recommended. The most evidence-based pediatric combination is a corticosteroid (eg, dexamethasone) plus a 5-HT3 antagonist (eg, ondansetron); timing matters.\n\n• Dexamethasone: Pediatric antiemetic dosing is commonly 0.15 mg/kg IV (typical max 4–8 mg). It should be administered after induction so that its delayed onset aligns with emergence. Benefits include reduced PONV and, in tonsillectomy, improved analgesia and decreased airway edema. Very high doses offer no added antiemetic benefit and may raise adverse-effect concerns.\n\n• Ondansetron: Pediatric dose ~0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg). Administer near the end of the case (eg, 10–15 minutes before emergence) because 5-HT3 antagonists have relatively rapid onset and shorter duration; giving them too early can reduce efficacy at the time of highest emetic stimulus.\n\n• Avoidance of $N_2O$: $N_2O$ increases PONV risk, particularly in high-risk pediatric procedures. When feasible, avoid $N_2O$ and minimize volatile and opioid exposure. Consider propofol maintenance or a propofol bolus near the end to further reduce PONV.\n\n• Alternative/adjuncts: Droperidol (eg, 0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV) is effective but carries QT prolongation and sedation warnings; use selectively with ECG awareness. Metoclopramide has weaker antiemetic efficacy in this context and is not preferred as sole prophylaxis.\n\n• Tonsillectomy considerations: Dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg is standard and reduces PONV and pain without clearly increasing postoperative hemorrhage at typical doses; continue opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia.\n\nKey points:\n- High-risk pediatric cases (strabismus, tonsillectomy) warrant combination prophylaxis.\n- Give dexamethasone at induction; give ondansetron near case end.\n- Avoid $N_2O$ and minimize emetogenic stimuli (volatiles, opioids); ensure euvolemia.\n\nPractical tip: For a short pediatric case, draw up dexamethasone to give right after IV placement and set a reminder to dose ondansetron ~10–15 minutes before anticipated emergence while avoiding $N_2O$ throughout.",

Avoid repeating within 6 hours due to receptor saturation and limited incremental benefit.\n- Dopamine $D_2$ antagonists: Droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV or haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV are effective PACU rescue options with onset in minutes. Monitor for QT prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms (rare at low doses).\n- Promotility/weak antiemetic: Metoclopramide 10 mg IV (dopamine $D_2$ antagonism, 5-HT$_4$ agonism) can be used as rescue; efficacy is modest but mechanism differs from $5$-$HT_3$ antagonists and steroids.\n- Antihistamines/anticholinergics: Promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg IV/IM works but may cause sedation and anticholinergic effects. Scopolamine patch is best as prophylaxis (onset 2–4 h), not PACU rescue.\n- $NK_1$ antagonists (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant): Excellent prophylaxis; oral aprepitant has delayed onset and is not first-line for acute rescue.\n\nOther considerations:\n- If QTc is prolonged, choose agents with less QT effect (eg, promethazine, low-dose haloperidol with caution) and avoid additive QT-prolonging combinations (droperidol, $5$-$HT_3$ antagonists).\n- Address reversible contributors (opioid minimization, hydration, untreated pain, hypotension).\n\nTypical rescue dosing (adult):\n- Droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV; Haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV; Metoclopramide 10 mg IV; Promethazine 6.25–12.5 mg IV/IM.\n\nPractical tip: If a patient received ondansetron at case end and vomits in the PACU within 6 hours, reach for a dopamine $D_2$ antagonist (eg, droperidol 0.625 mg IV) rather than more ondansetron.",

Volatile anesthetics and $N_2O$ increase PONV, whereas propofol-based TIVA reduces risk.

High-risk patients benefit from multimodal prophylaxis using different receptor targets, but they still require a clear at-home rescue strategy.\n\nKey principle: if prophylaxis included a given class, rescue should use a different class. Palonosetron has a long elimination half-life (~40 hours) with high 5-HT3 receptor affinity, so additional ondansetron within the first 24–48 hours provides little incremental benefit. Transdermal scopolamine delivers anticholinergic effect across the high-risk window; leaving it in place for at least 24 hours after surgery maintains protection while minimizing anticholinergic exposure. Dexamethasone improves early postoperative outcomes but does not obviate the need for home rescue therapy.\n\nAppropriate home rescue options include dopamine antagonists (eg, prochlorperazine 10 mg PO q6h PRN) or low-dose promethazine (eg, 12.5–25 mg PO q6–8h PRN with caution), started at the first sign of nausea. Counsel patients to avoid alcohol, sedatives, and driving while using sedating antiemetics, and to prioritize nonopioid analgesics to reduce emetogenic opioid exposure. Provide thresholds for escalation (eg, persistent vomiting >6–8 hours, inability to keep fluids down, signs of dehydration) and practical instructions for scopolamine patch handling (wash hands after touching; avoid eye contact to prevent mydriasis/blurred vision).\n\nCommon pitfalls include: repeating the same antiemetic class for rescue after long-acting prophylaxis, prematurely removing scopolamine, omitting explicit PRN dosing and safety instructions, and allowing driving despite sedating rescue medications.\n\nPractical tip: For high-risk ambulatory patients who received palonosetron, supply a dopamine antagonist for home rescue and keep the scopolamine patch on for 24 hours; give written instructions emphasizing early use at symptom onset, sedation precautions, and clear triggers to call for help.",

Risk is additive when multiple QT-prolonging drugs and predisposing factors are present.\n\nKey contributors and relative safety for PONV:\n- Prolong $QT_c$: droperidol, haloperidol, ondansetron/dolasetron/granisetron (class effect), phenothiazines (eg, promethazine), metoclopramide (modest, higher risk with predisposition).\n- Minimal/no $QT_c$ effect: dexamethasone, scopolamine, NK-1 antagonists (aprepitant/fosaprepitant/rolapitant), and propofol (useful as rescue 10–20 mg IV bolus).\n\nThis patient has multiple torsades risks: congenital long-$QT_c$, female sex, postoperative bradycardia, hypokalemia (K 3.2) and hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.7), and recent exposure to a 5-HT3 antagonist (ondansetron). The safest immediate strategy is to use a non–QT-prolonging rescue (propofol) and aggressively correct electrolytes (target K ≥4.0–4.5 mEq/L, Mg ≥2.0 mg/dL). Avoid adding dopamine antagonists or additional 5-HT3 antagonists. While palonosetron has minimal $QT_c$ effect, in the setting of marked prolongation with modifiable cofactors and recent 5-HT3 therapy, it is reasonable to defer and prioritize QT-neutral rescue and electrolyte normalization.\n\nAdditional strategies to lower PONV without affecting repolarization include reducing opioids, ensuring adequate hydration, and using NK-1 antagonists and scopolamine for prophylaxis. For refractory cases with sustained bradycardia and recurrent torsades (not this scenario), magnesium sulfate and overdrive pacing are acute arrhythmia therapies, not first-line antiemetic management.\n\nPractical tip: In any patient with $QT_c$ >500 ms or congenital long-$QT_c$, treat nausea with propofol rescue and correct K/Mg first; reserve QT-neutral prophylactics (dexamethasone, NK-1, scopolamine) and avoid stacking QT-prolonging antiemetics.",

Administering at induction aligns peak effect with emergence and early PACU, when PONV is most likely. Giving it at the end of the case is often too late to influence early postoperative nausea/vomiting.\n- 5-HT3 antagonists (eg, ondansetron 4 mg IV): onset is rapid (minutes), with clinical benefit when given near the end of surgery (eg, at skin closure or ~15–30 minutes before emergence). Early dosing at induction is less effective for immediate postoperative prophylaxis and may provide less receptor occupancy at the time risk peaks.\n\nOther timing pearls:\n- NK1 antagonists (eg, aprepitant oral) should be given preoperatively (1–3 hours before induction). Fosaprepitant IV can be administered at induction.\n- Dopamine antagonists (eg, droperidol 0.625–1.25 mg IV, haloperidol 0.5–1 mg IV) are typically given near the end of surgery.\n- Transdermal scopolamine should be applied at least 2–4 hours preoperatively (preferably the night before) to allow onset.\n\nCombining different classes (eg, dexamethasone at induction + ondansetron at closure) provides additive benefit without excessive side effects. Rescue therapy should use a different class than those used for prophylaxis.\n\nPractical tip: For cases ≥60–90 minutes with volatile anesthetics and planned opioids, cue an induction-time order for dexamethasone and an end-of-case reminder for ondansetron to reliably hit optimal timing windows.",

It also impedes insertion of a supraglottic airway and nasogastric tube.\n- When laryngoscopy is difficult but oxygenation is adequate, ask for graded easing of cricoid pressure while you perform bimanual laryngoscopy (your hand on the larynx to find the optimal position, then instruct the assistant to replicate). This often improves the view while retaining some protection.\n- If mask ventilation is inadequate or impossible, release cricoid pressure enough to permit ventilation; if still unable to ventilate, release it completely. Prioritize oxygenation over aspiration prophylaxis.\n- If active vomiting occurs, release cricoid pressure to reduce the risk of esophageal rupture and facilitate egress of gastric contents; suction and protect the airway.\n- Maintain cricoid pressure until the airway is secured (ETT cuff inflated and placement confirmed).

    "didactic": "Patients with mechanical bowel obstruction often have large-volume retained gastric contents despite prolonged NPO, opioids, or prokinetics. The single most effective and rapidly available maneuver to reduce aspiration during induction is gastric decompression with a nasogastric (or orogastric) tube to suction until minimal residual is obtained. This directly lowers intragastric volume and pressure, reducing the likelihood and severity of regurgitation if barrier pressure is overcome.\n\nKey points:\n- Small-bowel obstruction is a high-risk scenario because gastric emptying is impaired by a downstream mechanical block; NPO status does not predict a low gastric volume.\n- Prokinetics (eg, metoclopramide, erythromycin) are ineffective in mechanical obstruction and require time. Nonparticulate antacids (sodium citrate) and $H_2$ blockers reduce acidity but not volume; they mitigate pneumonitis severity, not aspiration occurrence.\n- Cricoid pressure has variable efficacy and can worsen laryngoscopic view or ventilation; release if it impedes airway management. It should not substitute for decompression in distention/obstruction.\n- Preoxygenation in a 20–30° head-up position improves oxygen reserves and may reduce regurgitation by lowering transdiaphragmatic gradient. Avoid positive-pressure mask ventilation if possible; if necessary for hypoxemia, use the lowest pressures (<12–15 cm $H_2$O) to limit gastric insufflation.\n- After intubation, recheck and continue gastric suctioning intraoperatively because proximal bowel may continue to reflux into the stomach.\n\nIntegration with other high-risk states:\n- Diabetic gastroparesis, GLP-1 agonists, and severe GERD increase aspiration risk via delayed emptying or low barrier pressure. Decompression is useful when significant gastric volume is suspected (eg, vomiting, ultrasound evidence) and particularly in obstruction.\n- Airway approach: RSI with full preoxygenation, head-up positioning, and avoidance of manual ventilation is standard; awake intubation is reasonable in extreme risk but does not replace decompression when large volumes are present.\n\nPractical tip: In obvious obstruction with active emesis, place an NG to low suction before induction and evacuate to minimal return, then perform head-up RSI with cricoid pressure applied only if it does not hinder laryngoscopy or ventilation.",

    "didactic": "RSI traditionally avoids mask ventilation to minimize gastric insufflation and aspiration. However, many patients desaturate rapidly during apnea, including those who are obese, pregnant, pediatric, or have shunt/atelectasis. In such cases, controlled, low-pressure mask ventilation during RSI is appropriate to prevent critical hypoxemia.\n\nKey principles:\n- Who benefits: Patients with low FRC and/or high $V\\!O_2$ (eg, obesity, late pregnancy), lung disease or shunt, inadequate preoxygenation, or anticipated prolonged apnea/intubation. Rapid $SpO_2$ decline after induction signals the need to ventilate.\n- How to ventilate safely: Use 100% O2 with a two-person mask seal and an oropharyngeal airway to minimize leak. Deliver small, slow breaths while limiting peak inspiratory pressure to ≤12–15 cm H2O. This threshold stays below typical esophageal opening pressure (~20 cm H2O), reducing gastric insufflation.\n- PEEP: 0–5 cm H2O may improve oxygenation if needed, but the critical safeguard is limiting peak inspiratory pressure. Prioritize head-elevated positioning and a good seal to avoid high pressures.\n- Cricoid pressure: Evidence for aspiration prevention is mixed; it can impede ventilation and laryngoscopy. If ventilation is ineffective at low pressures, instruct the assistant to reduce or release cricoid pressure.\n- Apneic oxygenation: Nasal cannula at 10–15 L/min can extend safe apnea time but is not a substitute for ventilation when $SpO_2$ is falling.\n\nRationale: Gastric insufflation risk rises as inspiratory pressure approaches the esophageal opening pressure. Gentle PPV with peak ≤12–15 cm H2O balances the competing priorities of oxygenation and aspiration prevention better than strict apnea or high-pressure bagging.\n\nPractical tip: Use pressure-controlled breaths (eg, inspiratory pressure 10–12 cm H2O, rate 6–8/min, PEEP 0–5) with continuous waveform capnography and a manometer. If the chest does not rise at ≤15 cm H2O, optimize mask seal/airway adjuncts and consider easing cricoid pressure before increasing pressure.",

However, when a difficult airway is anticipated, awake intubation is usually safer than RSI because it maintains spontaneous ventilation and airway protective reflexes until the trachea is secured.\n\nKey principles:\n- Awake intubation (flexible bronchoscopy or awake video laryngoscopy) with topicalization and minimal sedation is preferred when aspiration risk coexists with predicted difficult airway. Use head-elevated positioning, aggressive suctioning, antisialagogue (eg, glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg), and careful, titrated sedation to avoid emesis and loss of airway tone. After confirming endotracheal placement, proceed with induction and neuromuscular blockade.\n- Standard RSI: Preoxygenation with 100% $FiO_2$, rapid hypnotic plus fast-onset neuromuscular blocker (succinylcholine 1–1.5 mg/kg or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg), no mask ventilation, and prompt intubation. This minimizes gastric insufflation but is hazardous if laryngoscopy is predicted to be difficult.\n- Modified RSI: Allows gentle mask ventilation to prevent hypoxemia, using low inspiratory pressures (<10–12 cm $H_2O$) to limit gastric insufflation. Appropriate when oxygenation is a concern but airway difficulty is not extreme. Apply cricoid pressure only if it doesn’t impede ventilation or view; release if it does (evidence for benefit is limited).\n- Supraglottic airways do not reliably protect against aspiration and are poor first-line choices in high-risk patients with bowel obstruction.\n- Pharmacologic prophylaxis (nonparticulate antacid, H2 blocker or PPI, metoclopramide) may reduce acidity/volume but does not negate the need for an aspiration-mitigating airway plan.\n\nPractical tip: In full-stomach patients with anticipated difficulty, decompress the stomach, position head-elevated, prepare two suctions, topicalize thoroughly, and perform awake intubation; once the tube is secured, induce anesthesia and paralyze.",

Gentle, two-person mask ventilation with an effective mask seal, PEEP, and low inspiratory pressures (<12–15 cm H2O) can prevent hypoxemia while minimizing gastric insufflation. Gastric insufflation rises as airway pressure approaches esophageal opening pressure (~20 cm H2O). Barrier pressure concept: $P_{barrier} = P_{LES} - P_{gastric}$; higher airway pressures and sedation reduce LES tone, decreasing barrier pressure and increasing aspiration risk.\n- Cricoid pressure: Evidence does not show reduced aspiration; it can worsen the glottic view and impede ventilation. If used, apply properly and release immediately if it impairs laryngoscopy or ventilation.\n- Induction agents: Avoid large propofol boluses in hemorrhagic shock. Ketamine (supports sympathetic tone) or etomidate (hemodynamically stable) are preferred. For neuromuscular blockade, use succinylcholine (1–1.5 mg/kg) early after injury or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg for RSI conditions. Avoid succinylcholine after 24–72 hours in burns/crush/denervation due to hyperkalemia risk.\n- Airway contamination: Blood/vomit favors techniques resilient to soiling (e.g., video laryngoscopy with aggressive suction; SALAD technique).

If table tilt/wedge is unavailable, manual LUD (physically displacing the uterus to the left) effectively relieves aortocaval compression.\n- Head-up ramped position: A 20–30° head-up, ramped alignment (external auditory meatus to sternal notch) increases FRC and improves preoxygenation and laryngoscopy view, especially in obese parturients. Avoid Trendelenburg, which decreases FRC, worsens edema, and increases regurgitation risk.\n- Preoxygenation: Use 100% O2 with a tight mask seal for 3–5 minutes or 8 vital capacity breaths. Consider low-level PEEP (5–10 cm H2O) if tolerated to increase end-expiratory lung volume. Pregnant patients desaturate rapidly due to decreased FRC and increased O2 consumption.\n- Cricoid pressure: Apply at loss of consciousness; adjust or release if it impedes ventilation or laryngoscopy. It may reduce passive regurgitation but should never delay oxygenation or intubation.\n- Mask ventilation during RSI: Gentle mask ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures ≤ 20 cm H2O is appropriate to prevent hypoxemia, particularly in obese parturients. This pressure limit helps avoid insufflating the stomach and raising aspiration risk.\n- Intubation: Inflate the ETT cuff before positive-pressure ventilation. Use short-acting neuromuscular blockade (eg, succinylcholine 1–1.5 mg/kg TBW). Reduced pseudocholinesterase activity in pregnancy does not mandate dose reduction.\n- Aspiration prophylaxis: If time permits, administer a nonparticulate antacid (eg, sodium citrate), an H2 blocker, and metoclopramide. Insert an orogastric tube after intubation and cuff inflation to decompress the stomach.\n- Rescue oxygenation: If difficult mask ventilation or intubation occurs, prioritize oxygenation—optimize positioning, consider reducing/releasing cricoid pressure, and place a second-generation supraglottic airway, then proceed per obstetric difficult airway algorithm.\n\nPractical tip: When wedges/tilt are unavailable, assign a team member to continuous manual LUD from preoxygenation through intubation to maintain uteroplacental perfusion without delaying RSI.",

        "isCorrect": false,
        "explanation": "Although ketamine supports BP via sympathetic stimulation and is acceptable in TBI when ventilated, it can modestly increase IOP and is less ideal for an open globe; in catecholamine-depleted shock it may depress myocardium."
      }
    ],
    "didactic": "In RSI, induction agent choice must balance hemodynamics with cerebral and ocular physiology. Etomidate is preferred in unstable trauma: it maintains BP via minimal vasodilation/negative inotropy and reliably lowers CMRO₂, CBF, and ICP. Etomidate also decreases IOP, helping protect an open globe from extrusion during intubation and laryngoscopy. Single-dose adrenal suppression has not been shown to worsen outcomes in most emergent scenarios.\n\nKetamine increases sympathetic tone (↑HR, ↑MAP), preserves airway reflexes (not desired in RSI), and bronchodilates. Historically avoided in TBI, contemporary data show neutral or decreased ICP when patients are mechanically ventilated and normocapnic. However, ketamine can slightly increase IOP, making it less desirable in open-globe injuries. In severe hemorrhagic shock with catecholamine depletion, its direct myocardial depressant effects can unmask hypotension.\n\nPropofol and thiopental reduce ICP and IOP but commonly cause hypotension via vasodilation and myocardial depression—dangerous in hemorrhagic shock. Midazolam’s slower onset is suboptimal for RSI and lacks hemodynamic advantages.\n\nFor ocular trauma, prevent IOP surges from pain, coughing, and straining. Avoid succinylcholine due to transient IOP rise; instead, use rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg for rapid conditions. Optimize induction with gentle laryngoscopy, adequate analgesia, and prevention of hypoxia/hypercarbia. Maintain normocapnia ($PaCO_2$ ~35–40 mm Hg) to avoid ICP increases; brief mild hyperventilation can be considered if signs of herniation appear.\n\nKey points:\n- Etomidate: hemodynamically stable; ↓ICP and ↓IOP; ideal for hypotensive TBI/open globe.\n- Ketamine: supports BP; acceptable in TBI when ventilated; may ↑IOP slightly—avoid in open globe if alternatives exist.\n- Propofol/thiopental: ↓ICP/IOP but risk hypotension in shock.\n- Use high-dose rocuronium for RSI when succinylcholine is contraindicated.\n\nPractical tip: In borderline BP, have a vasopressor (eg, phenylephrine or push-dose epinephrine) ready and titrate reduced induction doses rather than committing to full “textbook” doses.",

        "isCorrect": false,

    "didactic": "Apneic oxygenation exploits the continued uptake of $O_2$ from alveoli into blood during apnea (≈250 mL/min in adults). If $O_2$ is continuously delivered to the nasopharynx, a diffusion/convection gradient draws $O_2$ into the alveoli without diaphragmatic movement. This can markedly delay desaturation, even though $CO_2$ elimination is minimal (rise ≈6 mm Hg in the first minute, then 3–4 mm Hg/min).\n\nKey physiology and math:\n- Denitrogenation increases alveolar $O_2$ stores. With full preoxygenation, alveolar $O_2$ store ≈ FRC × alveolar $FiO_2$. In an average adult, FRC ≈ 2.5 L supine; in obesity it is substantially reduced (often <1.5 L), shortening safe apnea time.\n- Alveolar gas equation: $PAO_2 = FiO_2(P_B - P_{H_2O}) - PaCO_2/R$. Maximizing $FiO_2$ and minimizing nitrogen before apnea optimizes $PAO_2$ and $O_2$ stores.\n\nWhy HFNC helps:\n- High flows (50–70 L/min) maintain a high pharyngeal $FiO_2$ during laryngoscopy, limiting room-air entrainment.\n- Provides a small CPAP effect (≈2–7 cm H2O, less with the mouth open), preserving FRC and delaying desaturation—especially useful in obesity.\n- Warmed, humidified gas improves tolerance and mucociliary function.\n- Does not impose positive-pressure ventilation into the stomach, so aspiration risk is not increased like with bag-mask ventilation.\n\nAlternatives:\n- Standard nasal cannula can provide effective apneic oxygenation when set to 10–15 L/min and left in place under the mask; lower flows (eg, 2–4 L/min) are inadequate in high-risk patients.\n- Nonrebreather masks or VCB preoxygenation improve preinduction $O_2$ stores but do not provide oxygen delivery during apnea.\n\nLimitations: Apneic oxygenation does not prevent $CO_2$ accumulation or acidosis; prolonged attempts still warrant aborting and re-oxygenating. Cricoid pressure neither improves preoxygenation nor apneic oxygenation and may hinder mask seal.\n\nPractical tip: In anticipated difficult or obese RSI cases, start HFNC at 50–60 L/min with $FiO_2$ 1.0 before induction and keep it on through laryngoscopy; if HFNC is unavailable, use standard nasal cannula at 15 L/min under the mask and continue during apnea.",
