# Repository Structure

## Top Level
- `data/` — bundled resources shipped with the app (`questions.json` and default `images/` assets).
- `dist/` — build artifacts generated by the packaging pipeline.
- `electron/` — main and preload processes that manage the desktop shell, config persistence, backup IO, and file system access.
- `src/` — renderer source for the React application.
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` — project manifest and dependency lockfile.

## `src/` Breakdown
- `index.html` — static shell loaded by Electron; mounts the React bundle.
- `main.jsx` — renderer entry point that mounts `<App />` and wires in error boundaries.
- `app/App.jsx` — top-level React component; coordinates data loading, routing between views, state mutations, and IPC calls.
- `components/`
  - `Dashboard.jsx` — summary metrics, quick session actions.
  - `SessionView.jsx` — in-session question flow, answer submission, flagging.
  - `SessionConfigurator.jsx` — modal for building session parameters with a live matching-question count.
  - `HistoryView.jsx` — past session list with filtering, scrollable attempt log, and restore logic.
  - `ContentView.jsx` — question browser, import/export utilities, and a custom question editor that supports adding/removing answer choices (text required, explanations optional) using a shared state builder to keep resets consistent.
  - `SettingsView.jsx` — surfaces user data paths, backup directory/automation controls, and lets users adjust default session configuration. The Backups panel now separates directory info, action buttons, and auto-backup preferences with aligned checkbox + interval inputs.
  - `Charts.jsx` — reusable chart primitives for dashboard analytics.
  - `Toast.jsx` — lightweight notification component.
- `constants.js` — shared enums/defaults (session config, status labels).
- `styles/globalStyles.js` — injected global styles, CSS variables, and shared form helpers used to align checkboxes with standard inputs.
- `utils/dataUtils.js` — normalization helpers, scoring logic, and aggregation utilities used by `<App />`.
